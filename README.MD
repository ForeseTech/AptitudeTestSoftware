## Why did we build this?
We run a chapter (club) at our college where we assist 500+ pre-final year students to prepare for their upcoming placements through a plethora of events such as mock interviews, aptitude tests and group discussions. It was a tedious process to format questions, distribute them to students, evaluate their answers and give them constructive feedback and so we decided to automate this process.
